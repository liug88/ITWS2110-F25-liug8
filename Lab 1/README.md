# ITWS-2100-Lab-1

# Personal Reflection
Doing this lab was actually pretty fun! As you can see through my commit history, I kind of went through each section one by one, starting with the personal info section, rthen my statement/intro, and then finally my education section. I always knew I wanted to mess around with JavaScript to show that I was experienced, but the codebase just got so long I ended up getting "dizzy" from all of the various stuff I had put in (slider animations, easter eggs, etc.) It got so confusing that at one point I started making simple copies of the HTML js and CSS to try to make sense of it, which didn't help much at all. In the end, I ended up refactoring my code so that my website looks pretty good, but not so much code that my style.css has 400 lines of code :D
