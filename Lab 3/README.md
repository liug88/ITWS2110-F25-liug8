# ITWS-2100-Lab-3

# Personal Reflection
It was super fun designing this website! I decided to go with a Pokemon API to kind of match what Pokemon fits the weather, as well as making a cute background for the weather because why not. I think a big struggle with this lab was making sure both APIs were able to make sense to each other (matching the Pokemon to the weather), but figuring out the extra credit actually wasn't that hard. It's just a simple function call!
