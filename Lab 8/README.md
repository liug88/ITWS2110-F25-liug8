# Lab 8 - SQL & PHP

Hello Juniper! This lab was pretty cool I guess. This was pretty chill since I'm sitting next to Jack, who is really good at this stuff. I learned a lot about SQL which is super useful for web development. One thing I slightly stuggled on was listing the students by sequences, but I was able to figure it out in the end.

On top of this, I finally got to see what the PHPmyadmin console looks like. Pretty cool I guess.

Hope you had a good break! I really hope you're not grading this during Thanksgiving lol
